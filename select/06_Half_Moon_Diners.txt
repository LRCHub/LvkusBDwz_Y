Half Moon
Is the only glow in the sky.
No stars
Through the haze and fog tonight.
So I am left here to explore
The starstuff that I am.
And I am left on earth,
With my body bound and flightless.
Laying on the floor in my house,
With all the time to be productive.
I choose to drag my feet and curse the sky,
Till I find something else to curse-
Till then I curse the sky.

Half Moon
Shining through my room, late at night.
My eyes adjusting to the light.
And it is strange that there are times when I forget how to fall asleep.
And there are times when I forget all the words I've been meaning to speak.
So I stare down at my feet,
Searching for an answer I won't find.
But I'll sit there so foolishly,
And I won't say a single word.

Half Moon,
Half Moon,
Half Moon,
Half Moon.
